The project describes what the (CNN) model does from start to finish to search and detect
pneumonia in a data set of chest images. This research is built on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) model that determines and classifies a person's level of pneumonia infection, whereas other
methods rely on traditional manual procedures to achieve the desired results. This model assists in
removing the reliability issues commonly encountered while working with medical photographs.
Deep learning tasks have perfect image datasets, but it is difficult to acquire such a large number
of pneumonia data-set images for such tasks; thus, various algorithms were installed in the model.
The detection method utilized here is CNN for detecting pictures and the beginning of pneumonia.
